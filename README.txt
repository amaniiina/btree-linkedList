Program description:

There are two different classes: btree.cpp, Linkedlist.cpp
btree.cpp- Sorted Binary tree implementation where smaller values are added to the left and bigger values to the right, using node struct with three 
variables: left and right nodes and an integer representing the value in each node. The class has two private fields: integer length and a root node. 
Linkedlist.cpp- singly linked list implementation using node class with two fields: node next: a pointer to next node in linked list and int data: 
representing the value in each node.  


Program files: 

btree.cpp- source code of btree
Linkedlist.cpp- source code of Linkedlist
main.cpp- tester
Header files:
btree.h- header file for binary tree class containing declarations of different functions 
Linkedlist.h- header file for linked list class containing declarations of different functions 


Compile and running: 
In Visual Studio IDE
To compile: Ctrl + shift + b 
To run: Ctrl + f5 

Input: 
Data that is added to Binary trees or Linked lists in the main

Output:
Binary trees and Linked lists printed to screen
